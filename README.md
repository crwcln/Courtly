# Courtly
The high-contrast Pickleball scoreboard designed for maximum visibility on the court.

Courtly is a lightweight web application built for pickleball players who need a clear, fast, and intuitive way to track scores and serving positions under bright sunlight.

✨ Features
High-Contrast Dark Mode: Deep black backgrounds with neon accents for readability through sunglasses.

Intuitive Controls: Bold "+" and "-" buttons with black symbols for instant recognition.

Smart Undo System: Mistake-proof scoring with a robust history stack.

Sidebar Settings: A clean, gesture-friendly settings drawer (no "X" button needed—just click off or hit Esc).

🛠️ Technical Highlights
GPU-Accelerated Text: Uses transform: translateZ(0) and -webkit-font-smoothing to prevent font-weight shifting during UI updates.
